# Input-Ouptut fork haskell-lmdb

See [README-old.md](./README-old.md) for the pre-fork README. This includes an
explanation for the Concordium fork that the current fork builds upon.

See [INPUT-OUTPUT-FORK.md](./INPUT-OUPUT-FORK.md) for reasons for the current
fork.

We follow processes and guidelines as established by the Consensus team at IOG.
A nice starting point for reading `ouroboros-consensus` documentation is
[ouroboros-network/ouroboros-consensus/README.md](
https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/blob/master/ouroboros-consensus/README.md).
